This is a page for my Eagle Scout project, completed on June 27th, 2020. While this project required little to no data-related skills and was completed during the summer between my senior year of high school and freshman year of college, it is still my greatest project to date. 

This project was completed on the site of a food bank in Amelia, Ohio owned by Inter Parish Ministries, a local church-affiliated service organization. The garden they had on-site was isolated from the main path leading from the parking lot into the building. When I first contacted them, I asked if they had any possible service project I could complete, and this was one of them!

Building a path connecting the garden with the main path would increase use of the garden and allow it to be more accessible to users. Preparing for the day when the project would be completed was the hardest part. It begun with fundraising about $1000 for all materials and equipment rentals. The plan was to initially have a concrete company come and pour into a foundation, however, paver stone turned into the material of choice for the path.

After some research and fundraising, I ordered all the materials needed and scheduled the equipment to be delivered. Unfortunately, I ran into a bad roadblock. The location of the food back was in a secluded area off a busy road, and there was not much signage leaded to the bank. The driver scheduled to deliver ~800 paver stones ended up not finding the area and taking the stones back to the origin. The workday was the next day, so that night, me and a few loyal friends got a pickup truck and hand loaded all of the stones. We drove the stones in batches and unloaded them on the site. It sucked in the moment, but all turned out okay.

The workday went smoothly.

The path turned out great and is still standing there today. I am happy to say that I added something that might improve even one person's well being. The project taught me a great deal of grit, project management, and service for others.
