Hi! Welcome to my website, and thank you for checking it out. Here you will find all major projects I have contributed to, led, and/or created. First, however, a little background. I am a fourth-year student at Ohio State University (OSU) studying Data Analytics, on track to graduate in the Fall of 2024. During the first couple years at OSU, I was actually as Business Operations major, confused on where I wanted to go with my major. Discovering my love for statistics and analytics through a few core courses, I decided to switch my major to Data Analytics, yet still maintaing that connection to business by specializing in Business Analytics. 

I continue my journey to the present, having joined a business fraternity, TAed a course, and worked an analytics role at Nationwide Insurance. My experiences have enabled me to become a mesh of both business accumen and technical knowledge, and I am looking to apply this experitise to an internship in the summer of 2024. Check out my Github and LinkedIn below, but I am best reached at my email.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
