Hi! Welcome to my website, and thank you for checking it out. Here you will find all major projects I have contributed to, led, and/or created. First, however, a little background. I am a fourth-year student at Ohio State University (OSU) studying Data Analytics, on track to graduate in the Fall of 2024. During the first couple years at OSU, I was actually as Business Operations major, confused on where I wanted to go with my major. Discovering my love for statistics and analytics through a few core courses, I decided to switch my major to Data Analytics, yet still maintaing that connection to business by specializing in Business Analytics. 

I continue my journey to the present, having joined a business fraternity, TAed a course, and worked an analytics role at Nationwide Insurance. My experiences have enabled me to become a mesh of both business accumen and technical knowledge, and I am looking to apply this experitise to an internship in the summer of 2024. Check out my Github and LinkedIn below and the CV tab above!

I also go by Jack, not John.
