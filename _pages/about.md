Hi! Welcome to my website, and thank you for checking it out. Here you will find a working list of all major projects I have contributed to, led, and/or created. First, however, a little background. I am a fourth-year student at Ohio State University (OSU) studying Data Analytics, on track to graduate in the Fall of 2024. During the first couple of years at OSU, I was a Business Operations major, confused about where I wanted to go with my major. Upon discovering my love for statistics and analytics through a few core courses, I decided to apply and was accepted into the Data Analytics major. Simultaneously, I realized the value of how a strong business foundation would complement my affinity for data analytics, which prompted me to specialize in Business Analytics.

I continue my journey to the present, having joined a business fraternity, served as a Teaching Assistant for a course, and worked in an analytics role at Nationwide Insurance. My experiences have enabled me to become a mesh of both business acumen and technical knowledge, and I am looking to apply this expertise to an internship in the summer of 2024. Check out my GitHub and LinkedIn below and the CV tab above!

I also go by Jack, not John.
